# 2020_ORTA_RobustKnapsackProblem

LP model and two heuristics (graph-based and genetic-based) to solve the Robust Knapsack Problem.
The report with all the needed explanations and results of this work is the file RKP_report.pdf. Folder Report_codes contains all the latex and accessory files used for the production of the final pdf.

## Instructions to run the code:
* Download a config file from the ConfigFiles folder (or the basic, dummy one in the main directory)
* Download genetic_heuristic.py, graph_heuristic.py and/or mainRobust.py (with RobustKnapsack.py and Instance.py) to run respectively the heuristic based on the genetic algorithm, that based on the graph algorithm or the model.
* Set in the downloaded python file the name of the specific config file
* Run the code for the chosen instance
